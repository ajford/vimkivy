vimkivy
=======

vimkivy is a vim plugin for support of the [Kivy][] language.
It was not written by me, but compiled from [tshirtman's vim files][tshirtman].
All credit goes to him. 

I use [Vundle][] to manage my Vim plugins, so I created this repo to assist in
compartmentalizing this for easy use with vundle.
